# DateAdvanceApp-Exercise

Part 1: Next day
- Implement the method public void advance() that moves the date by one day. In this exercise we assume that each month has 30 day.

Part 2: Advance specific number of days
- Implement the method public void advance(int howManyDays) that moves the date by the number of days that is given.

Part 3: Passing of time
- Let's add the possibility to advance time to the SimpleDate class. Create the method public SimpleDate afterNumberOfDays(int days) for the class. It creates a new SimpleDate object whose date is the specified number of days greater than the object that the method was called on. You may still assume that each month has 30 days. Notice that the old date object must remain unchanged!
